    "Encapsulates a playback environment.

An environment is used for horizontal mixing and contains a set of
track lists. The environment controls playback of the segments within
the track lists by ensuring that play heads are synchronised when
switching and allowing smooth transitioning between segments.

When initialising an environment, you may pass a :SETS argument, which
should be a list of the following structure:

  SETS ::= (SET*)
  SET  ::= (name SOURCE*)
  SOURCE ::= input | (input INITARGS*)

Where input and initargs are sutable for use with CREATE. The name
given names the state in which the environment must be for the
associated list of sources to be played back. The class used to create
is a MUSIC-SEGMENT.

The environment will continuously loop the current list of tracks
smoothly until it transitions to another state.

    A sequence of sample points at which a transition is considered to

    transition will happen immediately.

  :TRANSITION-INTERVAL
  :TRANSITION-OFFSET
    Combined with :TRANSITION-OFFSET, defines the set of sample points
    where a transition is favourable. You may use this instead of
    :TRANSITION-POINTS if the points are always equidistant.
    Meaning, if (SAMPLE - TRANSITION-OFFSET % TRANSITION-INTERVAL) = 0
    a transition point is generated.

  :TRANSITION-FUN
    Instead of the above methods, you may also specify a manual

    a boolean indicating whether a transition may occur between OLD

This function will compose a server with a mixing graph, ready for

NAME is the name of the program as it may appear in the operating
system's mixer.

SAMPLERATE is the global samplerate used by the pipeline.

LATENCY (in seconds) is used to compute the standard buffer
size. Setting this to 0.02 or so should be safe.

DRAIN should be the type of output drain to construct. If T is given,
an appropriate drain for the current platform is detected
automatically.

DEVICE is a hint passed on to the output drain to select a specific
output device. Usually a string of some kind, though the semantics are
drain-dependent.

OUTPUT-CHANNELS is the number of channels of the internal mixing
hierarchy. Note that the drain may still perform conversion to upmix
or downmix regardless of this setting.

SOURCE, if given, should be the type of output drain to construct. If
T is given, an appropriate source for the current platform is detected
automatically. Note that if you construct a source, its device chain
is added to the :SOURCES chain and named :INPUT. It is *not* connected
to anything, however, and will stall out immediately unless you
connect it to something to consume the samples. For a basic loopback,
you can connect it to one of the mixers, for instance.

SOURCE-DEVICE is a hint passed on to the input source to select a
specific input device. Usually a string of some kind, though the
semantics are source-dependent.

INPUT-CHANNELS is the number of channels the input should have,
typically one.

EFFECTS is a list of effects specs:

  EFFECT ::= class-designator | (class-name initarg*)

Each of the effects is applied in the same order as described and
applies to the audio stream right before output to the drain. Harmony
will automatically take care of matching up channel counts and
duplicating effects in BUNDLEs if necessary to upmix.

MIXERS is a list of mixer specs describing the mixers that are
available on the server. All of the mixers are ultimately combined
into one stream before output. The mixer specs are as follows:

  MIXER ::= name | (name class-designator [:effects (EFFECT*)] initarg*)

Effects here are as described above, applied to the output buffers of
the mixer.

named :MASTER. It will also always have two named chains, :OUTPUT and
:SOURCES.
